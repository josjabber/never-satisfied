        <div class="text">
            Kick, score, goal... <span class="hover-text">It was all a dream</span>
            As I look up into the stands, all I see is celebration <span class="hover-text">Mundane office walls overtake me</span>
            The joy that comes from winning a game never fades, even after years of playing <span class="hover-text">Depression consumed me over the years</span>
            Forever grateful for choosing soccer in college, I would have never got to this point had I not <span class="hover-text">A useless college degree</span>
            I make my way home after the game, kids and husband waiting for me. <span class="hover-text">Bottles waiting for me at home</span>
            I unwind, curl up in bed and let out a sigh. <span class="hover-text">The day is finally over</span>
            <span class="hover-text">A life of stagnancy was one I never suspected as a child</span>
            A life of fame was not one I saw plausible. <span class="green-hover">Never satisfied</span>
            All of these games, the same result, what if I want more? <span class="hover-text">At least I am stable, at least I am alive</span>
            <span class="green-hover">What will be enough</span>
            I have everything I could ask for, money, fame, what about love. <span class="hover-text">I have all I could need, drinks, money, stability, but what about love</span>
            <span class="green-hover">All the same</span>
            <span class="hover-text">They say a life without love is no life at all, so what am I living. Am I to work my life away without someone to love?</span>
            There must be more to life than medals, love must be more. <span class="green-hover">Love is enough</span>
